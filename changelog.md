# Version 1.21.0

#### In this version:

Added SafetyCheck to the Feature list.
If enabled (default),
players have the ability to turn of/off the safety check of a teleportation source
(for more information about SafetyCheck, see [here](https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/quickStart.md#safety-check-tport-safetycheck-source-state-)).
If the feature is disabled, the state of every safety check is disabled (nobody can use it).

Added adapter for 1.21

Added copper grates for the structure icon

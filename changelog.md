# Version 1.20.7

#### In this version:

### Fixed for older versions

No longer getting the error on plugin load: java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: EXPLOSION.

Adaptive adapter now works as normal

Fixed an NMS error. If the lore of an item in a window was empty, the error did occur. This won't happen anymore

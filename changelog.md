# Version 1.21.4

Fixed issue where teleporting to a world using History (with a World location source) would give an error showing that the world does not exist.

Changes where made in the FancyMessage JSON translator to reflect the new changes in Minecraft since 25w02a


### Advancements

Added advancements to TPort.
These advancements are visible in the advancement window of Minecraft self.
Using the `Advancement` feature you can enable/disable this feature.
There are currently 35 advancements to be earned, with 1 hidden easter egg.

To use the advancements you need the following plugin:
CrazyAdvancementAPI (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/crazy-advancements-api.51741/)

### Language

The language settings window has been created.
In the settings window you can now use the language button to change your language,
and the language of the server.

### Adapters

The adapter for 1.21.4 & 1.21.3 contains a bug where FeatureTP is not working correctly.
This issue has been addressed in this update for adapter 1.21.4 & 1.21.3.

There is now also an adapter for 1.21.5.

# Version 1.21.3

## In this version:

### Created adapter for Minecraft 1.21.4


### Quick type in the keyboard got improved:

When left click, each new line in the sign will show as a new line
example:
- line 1: 'test a'
- line 2: 'test b'
- line 3: ''
- line 4: ''
- output:  
  'test a
  test b'

When right click, each new line in the sign will show as a space
example:
- line 1: 'test a'
- line 2: 'test b'
- line 3: ''
- line 4: ''
- output:  
  'test a test b'

When shift right click, each new line in the sign will show behind each other
example:
- line 1: 'test a'
- line 2: 'test b'
- line 3: ''
- line 4: ''
- output:  
  'test atest b'

### Color editor in the keyboard:
Shift+left removed all color from text

Click your drop key (+ shift) on the color editor to create a color fade. You can add colors to create the fade with.

### Offline/Online mode
On startup TPort will check the online/offline mode of the server. If this mode has changed since the installation of TPort, a warning will be displayed.
This warning is to inform the server admin that changing this mode is not supported.
Players will lose their settings/TPorts.

# Version 1.21.2

#### In this version:

Created a new adapter for Minecraft 1.21.3

## History
This feature is now in pre-release state. This feature records all teleports a player has, and stores it in a list.
This will replace `/tport back` in the future.
Your teleport history will record all teleports you have done, even from other plugins and Minecraft self.
Each teleport is an entry in your history, each entry contains several elements:
- From  
  This is the location from which you teleported from.
- To  
  This is the location from which you teleported to. This can be a location or an object.
  This can be for example a TPort or a player, this allows it to be adaptable.
  If the tport is moved, this history element will teleport you to the correct location.
  This adaptable location will only work if the plugin who executed the teleport support the TPort History feature.
  For an example: if you teleport to a biome using BiomeTP, it will show two `to` locations, one is the name of the biome, and the other is the actual xyz location.
- Cause  
  The cause is the reason you have teleported, this can be `ENDER_PEARL` or `NETHER_PORTAL`, or `PLUGIN:TPort`.
  It is possible to filter for these causes.
- Plugin (Optional)  
  If the teleport is executed by a plugin, TPort will search for which plugin was responsible and shows this in the `plugin` tag.
  It is possible to filter for these plugins.
- Type (Optional)
  If the plugin has implemented this feature, the plugin can also name the feature/type of teleport.
  For example, if you teleport to a player using TPort, the `plugin` will be `TPort`, and the `type` will be `PLTP`.





To open your history, use `/tport history`, or open it in the main TPort window (![](https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/texture_generator/src/main/resources/icons/x32/history.png?raw=true "History")  )

The commands are:
- /tport history
  open your teleport history.
- /tport history back [filter]
  teleport to the last element from location.
- /tport history tmpName [filter]
  teleport to the last element to location.  
  This command has yet to be renamed.
- /tport history clear [filter]
  Clear your teleport history
- /tport history size [size]
  Get/set the maximum size of a teleport history.

---

#### Add History support to your plugin
If you are a developer and want to add support for the History, you have to tell TPort before teleporting what type of teleport your plugin is executing via this one line:

``` java
TeleportHistory.setLocationSource(player.getUniqueId(), new CraftLocationSource());
player.teleport(location);
```
This tells the history manager how to handle this location.
You can also use a custom location source:
``` java
TeleportHistory.setLocationSource(player.getUniqueId(), new ExampleLocationSource(liveLocationObject));
```

A Location Source is an object that handles the teleport information and teleporting.
The LocationSource extends the Encapsulation class.
This class is for formatting the object to text (in windows and chat).

In this small tutorial we will create a custom Location Source, named ExampleLocationSource.
Create your own class implementing LocationSource (com.spaceman.tport.history.locationSource.LocationSource)
After this step, implement all methods, it then should look like this:

``` java
public class ExampleLocationSource implements LocationSource {
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public Location getLocation(Player player) {
        return null;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void setLocation(Location location) {
        
    }
    
    @Override
    public void teleportToLocation(Player player) {
        
    }
    
    @Override
    public void notSafeToTeleport(Player player) {
        
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public InventoryModel getInventoryModel() {
        return null;
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public String getType() {
        return "";
    }
    
    @Override
    public boolean getSafetyCheckState(Player player) {
        return false;
    }
    
    @Override
    public String asString() {
        return "";
    }
    
    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public Message toMessage(String color, String varColor) {
        return null;
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public HoverEvent getHoverEvent() {
        return null;
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public ClickEvent getClickEvent() {
        return null;
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public String getInsertion() {
        return "";
    }
}

```

Methods from Encapsulation:

- String asString()  
  This should return the String value of the location source.
  Examples: the biome, player name, TPort name, feature name, ect.
- Message toMessage(String color, String varColor)  
  This should return the Message object. This object is the actual text used for the chat and TPort windows.
  The default implementation looks like this:
    ``` java
      @Nonnull
      @Override  
      Message toMessage(String color, String varColor) {
        return new Message(new TextComponent(asString(), varColor));
      }
    ```
  But more customisation is possible.
- HoverEvent getHoverEvent()  
  The hover event is a message wrapped as a HoverEvent object that shows when you hover your mouse over the location source in chat.
- ClickEvent getClickEvent()  
  The click event is the event that runs when a player clicks the location source in chat.
- String getInsertion()  
  The insertion is the string that copies to the chat of the player when they shift click the location source.
  The default implementation could look like this:
    ``` java
      @Nullable
      @Override  
      String getInsertion() {
        return asString();
      }
    ```
  But more customisation is possible.


These methods are used to convert the LocationSource to a string to show in chat and in the TPort windows.
The remaining methods are for the location source.
When the teleport occurs, TPort will catch the event and assigns the new location to the location source via the setLocation method.
But if you use a live location (adaptable) you have to store a way in the source to get the live location.

After implementing all methods your class should look something like this:

```java
public class ExampleLocationSource implements LocationSource {
    
    // implementation for a live location (adaptable)
    private final Object liveLocation;
    
    // implementation for a static location
    private Location location;
    
    public ExampleLocationSource(Object liveLocation) {
        // Constructor to store your live location.
        // This object can be anything, for a TPort teleportation, the TPort object is stored, so when the owner of the TPort changed the location, this reference will also update.
        this.liveLocation = liveLocation;
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public Location getLocation(Player player) {
        // live location implementation
        // Use the correct way to get the location
        return (Location) liveLocation;
        
        // static location implementation
        //return location
    }
    
    @Override
    public void setLocation(Location location) {
        // If you use a custom live location (adaptable), this method can stay empty.
        // Otherwise, use this location
        this.location = location;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void teleportToLocation(Player player) {
        // If a custom teleport sequence is needed, put that here, otherwise use player.teleport(location).
        // Or use the teleport from TPort (this is boat/horse friendly and works with the delay/restriction of TPort):
        //      TPEManager.requestTeleportPlayer(player, getLocation(player),
        //            () -> /*send message that teleport is succeeded*/,
        //            (player, delay, tickMessage, seconds, secondMessage) -> /*send message that teleport is requested*/);
        // Or use only the boat/horse friendly teleport:
        //      TPEManager.teleportPlayer(player, getLocation(player));
        // It is also possible to handle the teleportation by another command
        //      Bukkit.dispatchCommand(player, "tp " + player + " " + getLocation(player));
        
        // Use the getLocation(player) for the teleport.
    }
    
    @Override
    public void notSafeToTeleport(Player player) {
        // Send message that it is not safe to teleport to the location
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public InventoryModel getInventoryModel() {
        // If you don't have texture pack support just return null, the default texture will be used
        // If you do have a resource pack, create a new InventoryModel object:
        // new InventoryModel(material, custom model data)
        return null;
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public String getType() {
        // return the type of the location source, return null if you don't have any subtypes of sources.
        return "example";
    }
    
    @Override
    public boolean getSafetyCheckState(Player player) {
        // Return the default state of the safety check state, by default use this:
        // return TPORT_BACK.getState(player);
        return TPORT_BACK.getState(player);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String asString() {
        // This should return the String value of the location source.
        // Examples: the biome, player name, TPort name, feature name.
        return "example";
    }
    
    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public Message toMessage(String color, String varColor) {
        // This should return the Message object. This object is the actual text used for the chat and TPort windows.
        // The default implementation could look like this:
        //
        // @Nonnull
        // @Override
        // Message toMessage(String color, String varColor) {
        //     return new Message(new TextComponent(asString(), varColor));
        // }
        //
        // But more customisation is possible.
        return new Message(new TextComponent(asString(), varColor));
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public HoverEvent getHoverEvent() {
        // The hover event is the message wrapped as a HoverEvent object that shows when you hover your mouse over the location source in chat.
        return null;
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public ClickEvent getClickEvent() {
        // The click event is the event that runs when a player clicks the location source in chat.
        return null;
    }
    
    @Nullable
    @Override
    public String getInsertion() {
        // The insertion is the string that copies to the chat of the player when they shift click the location source.
        // The default implementation could look like this:
        //
        // @Nullable
        // @Override
        // String getInsertion() {
        //     return asString();
        // }
        //
        // But more customisation is possible.
        return asString();
    }
}

```

If you are using custom textures, you can TPort what InventoryModel it should use to display in the filter window.
Each plugin can set their own icon as filter icon.
To register your InventoryModel, use this line:
``` java
TeleportHistory.registerPluginFilterModel(this, YOUR_INVENTORY_MODEL);
```

# Version 1.21.1

#### In this version:

History is still in beta. Only the history window is available. In here you can see your teleport history.

The adapters are working again for Paper servers.

---

# Version 1.21.0

#### In this version:

Added SafetyCheck to the Feature list.
If enabled (default),
players have the ability to turn of/off the safety check of a teleportation source
(for more information about SafetyCheck, see [here](https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/quickStart.md#safety-check-tport-safetycheck-source-state-)).
If the feature is disabled, the state of every safety check is disabled (nobody can use it).

Added adapter for 1.21

Added copper grates for the structure icon

---

# Version 1.20.7

#### In this version:

### Fixed for older versions

No longer getting the error on plugin load: java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: EXPLOSION.

Adaptive adapter now works as normal

Fixed an NMS error. If the lore of an item in a window was empty, the error did occur. This won't happen anymore

---

# Version 1.20.6

#### In this version:

### updated to Minecraft 1.20.5

With NBT tags getting removed, some changed in the code where made.
With this a new adapter is made: 1.20.5.
The adaptive adapter is not fully functional yet.
The resource pack _pack format_ is updated to 32.

The default particle of the animations where: `EXPLOSION_NORMAL`. Since 1.20.5 this does not exist anymore. This is now `EXPLOSION`
When using older versions, an error will occur. This is fixed in this version.

### Fixes some bugs with Search.

- Looped queries now work in the Search window (biome searcher).
- Minecraft tag list are now updated when searching for BiomePresets.
- Whitelist and Blacklist biome presets are now used correctly.

### Language files are now correctly loaded on platforms other than Windows.

### CompanionTP

Teleporting with a boat now won't change your chest boat into a regular boat.  
Added CompanionTP as a feature. With this you can enable/disable that boats, horses and leashed entities will teleport with you.
To change this setting: ``/tport features CompanionTP state <state>``

### Added the History beta feature
This keeps track on every teleport a player makes.
Depending on the final form of History, this will fully replace the `/tport back` system.
You can enable/disable History via the Features command (`/tport features history state <state>`)

How History works:  
For every teleport a player makes, TPort will check the cause of the teleport.
If the cause of the teleport comes from a plugin, TPort will look up which plugin issued
the teleport. Every data is stored in a History Element. This looks like this:
```
location before teleport -> location after teleport.
Cause: teleport cause, Source: plugin
```
Example of an ender pearl:
```
{world, x=0, y=0, z=0} -> {world, x=1, y=1, z=1}.
Cause: ENDER_PEARL, Source: null
```
Or teleporting to a TPort:
```
{world, x=0, y=0, z=0} -> home.
Cause: PLUGIN, Source: TPort
```

There are a few commands to use the history:

* `/tport history`  
  This is the command to see your history
* `/tport history back [filter]`  
  This is the command to teleport back. It uses the _location before teleport_ of the last history element
* `/tport history last`  
  This is the command to teleport back. It uses the _location after teleport_ of the last history element
* `/tport history secondLast`  
  This is the command to teleport back. It uses the _location after teleport_ of the second last history element
* `/tport history clear`  
  This command is used to clear your history
* `/tport history size [size]`  
  This command is used to edit the size of the history

### The icons for WorldTP have been renamed:
- overworld -> world_tp_overworld![](https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/texture_generator/src/main/resources/icons/x32/world_tp_overworld.png?raw=true "Over world")
- nether -> world_tp_nether![](https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/texture_generator/src/main/resources/icons/x32/world_tp_nether.png?raw=true "Nether")
- the_end -> world_tp_the_end![](https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/texture_generator/src/main/resources/icons/x32/world_tp_the_end.png?raw=true "The End")
- other_environments -> world_tp_other_environments![](https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/texture_generator/src/main/resources/icons/x32/world_tp_other_environments.png?raw=true "Other environments")

### BlueMap:
TPort BlueMap states are now saved. In the previous version the show state was not saved.  
Added icon support. When BlueMap support is enabled,
TPort will create the `blueMapImages` folder inside the TPort folder.
Every `png` and `jpg` will be added to the assets storage of BlueMap.
Only these images are usable for TPort.
The images will be scaled to 32x32 resolution.
To select an icon for TPort use this command `/tport edit <TPort name> blueMap icon [icon name]`.
Or edit the icons via the QuickEdit (show state: <img height="32" src="https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/texture_generator/src/main/resources/icons/x32/quick_edit_bluemap_show_on.png?raw=true" title="BlueMap show state on" width="32"/><img height="32" src="https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/texture_generator/src/main/resources/icons/x32/quick_edit_bluemap_show_off.png?raw=true" title="BlueMap show state off" width="32"/><img height="32" src="https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/texture_generator/src/main/resources/icons/x32/quick_edit_bluemap_show_grayed.png?raw=true" title="BlueMap not enabled" width="32"/>, icon: ![](https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/texture_generator/src/main/resources/icons/x32/quick_edit_bluemap_icon.png?raw=true "BlueMap icon")![](https://github.com/JasperBouwman/TPort/blob/master/texture_generator/src/main/resources/icons/x32/quick_edit_bluemap_icon_grayed.png?raw=true "BlueMap not enabled"))

### Added four new redirects:

- TPA_PLTP_TP  
  Redirect `/tpa <player>` to `/tport pltp tp <player>`
- TPAccept_Requests_accept  
  Redirect `/tpaccept [player]` to `/tport requests accept [player]`
- TPDeny_Requests_reject  
  Redirect `/tpdeny [player]` to `/tport requests reject [player]`
- TPRevoke_Requests_revoke  
  Redirect `/tprevoke` to `/tport requests revoke`
- TPRandom_BiomeTP_random  
  Redirect `/randomtp` and `/tprandom` to `/tport biomeTP random`

default state for all is `false`.

---

# Version 1.20.5

### In this version:

TPort does not crash anymore on server load.

`/tport help` is now a bit smarter.
Previously when searches for `/tport edit home item` it would not find any commands matching. Now it will ignore variables.
Now when searching `/tport edit home item` it will find this command.  
If you are struggling with a command, you can just add `tport help` before your command.  
Also added back propagation for searches. When searching for `/tport biomeTP accuracy default` these command will be found:
- /tport biomeTP
- /tport biomeTP accuracy
- /tport biomeTP accuracy <size>

This should help you in showing more relatable matches

---

# Version 1.20.4

updated the resource pack format to 22

Finished the Logging setting  
Auto backups are working again

Added Item Selection in the Quick Edit menu  
Added whitelist clone to the Quick Edit menu

Full update for Search
- Added World search type. Search for TPorts that are in the given world
- Added OwnedTPorts search type. Search for players owned TPorts
- Search can now be run with inventories, use `/tport search` or find it in the settings screen
- Added new search modes: not equals, ends with, not contains

Added full adapter support
- server admins now can select the best adapter for their server
- The default is set to automatic, this chooses based upon the server version the best adapter
- The end goal is that each Minecraft version has their own adapter
- The adaptive adapter should mainly be used if your version does not exist (example: using TPort for a new Minecraft version that TPort does not yet have a adapter for)
- If the selected adapter does not load the adaptive is used as a backup
- command: /tport adapter [adapter]
- permissions: tport.adapter or tport.admin for setting the adapter
- selecting the adapter can also be done via the setting menu

Added beta support for BlueMap
- Works the same as the Dynmap support
- to enable: `/tport features blueMap state true`, and make sure that BlueMap is successfully loaded into your server
- For now only a toggle for showing state on the map is available using: `/tport edit <TPort name> blueMap show [state]  `

Added a safety check to PLTP
- `/tport PLTP tp <player> [safetyCheck]  `
- when teleport needs to be requested, the check is preformed after the request is accepted  
  Another safety check is preformed for teleporting to a TPort
- the owner of the TPort can move the TPort to a dangerous location in between the request and accepting

More features for the Keyboard:
- you can now delete a color
- in the color selector, you can select a color from Minecraft (Chat Colors & Dye Colors)  
  This built-in color selector is also used for creating your own color theme

Renamed TPort private state 'prion' to PRIVATE_ONLINE

New icons for the transfer system. Check them out in: settings, transfer window offered/offers filter and in the Quick Edit window

Added a command to fully stop logging a TPort
- `/tport log delete <TPort name>`
- This removes all players from the logged players list, and sets the default log mode to NONE

Added LookTP to the features list. Default value is on  
Added EnsureUniqueUUID to the features list. Default value is off.
- This feature was already in TPort, but its now changeable.
- When enabled, TPort will look at all existing TPorts and check if the new UUID for the new TPort is truly unique.
- The changes of it randomly creating a UUID that is already in use is animatronic low.

When Permissions are disabled, they won't show anymore in the help page (`/tport help <command>`)

Added `/tport language repair <language> [repair with] [dump]`.  
When dump is set to true, it prints all repaired ID's in the console

`/tport back <safetyCheck>` now uses the correct safetyCheck permissions.
- old: (TPort.Back and TPort.safetyCheck.TPORT_PUBLIC) or TPort.basic
- new: (TPort.Back and TPort.safetyCheck.TPORT_BACK) or TPort.basic

fixed some minor bugs

# Changelog 1.18.2 update:

* TPort now supports translations. A server can set a default language, every player can follow the server of select their own one.
* When a server has not installed a language a player wants, they can set their language to 'custom'.
* This way TPort does not translate any messages (for them), but lets their Minecraft do it. The player must use a TPort Language Resource Pack,
* this works the same as selecting a texture/resource pack. Now TPort is translatable in any language anyone wants (not restricted by the server).
* commands:
*  /tport language server [language]
*  /tport language get
*  /tport language set custom
*  /tport language set server
*  /tport language set <server language>
*  /tport language repair <language> [repair with]
*  /tport language test <id>
*
* Changed FeatureTP (now works with Minecraft 1.18.2)
*  /tport featureTP search <feature> [mode] -> /tport featureTP search [mode] <feature...>
*  You can search for multiple features at the same time
*  The Taglists from Minecraft can be used
*
* Changed BiomeTP
*  When the TPort version supports the Minecraft version (no legacy support):
*      - tab completes only shows the biomes that are generated in the world the player is in
*      - BiomeTP GUI only shows the biomes that are generated in the world the player is in
*      - The Taglists from Minecraft are added to the Presets
*  When an error occurs BiomeTP Legacy support is turned on
*
* Removed converting functions. If you are upgrading to 1.18.2 (or higher) from a version lower than 1.15.3 you need to install 1.16.2 first.
* you could suffer from data loss if you upgrade to 1.18.2 (or higher) from a version lower than 1.15.3
*
* Improved some GUI's. Middle Click is now replaced by Shift Right Click. Only Creative players could use the Middle Click Button.
* In the future there will be more functions bind to other mouse clicks (like Shift Left Click)
*
* removed bug when you create a TPort you will get the error if you don't have permission to add a description when you aren't adding a description
* improved stability
* when a TPort is transferred, the old owner will now be automatically added to the whitelist
* fixed /tport edit <TPort name> whitelist add <player names...>
*
* changed /tport safetyCheck
*  new commands:
*   /tport safetyCheck
*   /tport safetyCheck <source> [state]
*   /tport safetyCheck check
*   /tport open <player> [TPort name] [safetyCheck]
*   /tport own [safetyCheck]
*   /tport home [safetyCheck]
*   /tport public open <TPort name> [safetyCheck]
* The source stands for the source of reason for teleportation. open, own, home and public is their own source.
* This way you can set the default state for each command
* '/tport safetyCheck check' is to check if the location you are at is considered safe by the safety checker
*
* added/changed TPort private settings:
*  OFF -> OPEN. better name for its function
*  ON -> PRIVATE. better name for its function
*  + CONSENT_PRIVATE. when the owner is online players must get consent of owner, when the owner is offline the TPort goes to PRIVATE
*  + CONSENT_CLOSE. when the owner is online players in the whitelist can ask for consent to teleport, when the owner is offline the TPort closes
* for CONSENT settings some commands where added, these work the same as the ones for PLTP:
*  /tport requests
*  /tport requests accept [player...]
*  /tport requests reject [player...]
*  /tport requests revoke
* '/tport requests' now handles all the teleportation requests, from PLTP and normal TPort teleportation.
*   As of now you only can have only one request (to a player with PLTP or to a TPort)
*
* You are now able to log yourself.
*  To start: /tport log add <TPort name> YourName:[ALL|ONLINE]
*  To stop:  /tport log add <TPort name> YourName:[NONE|OFFLINE]
*            /tport log remove <TPort name> YourName
*
* changed '/tport redirect <redirect> [state]' to '/tport redirect [redirect] [state]'
*
* added /tport features [feature] state [state]
* This command allows you to enable/disable features without the use of permissions
* /tport metrics enable [state]     -> /tport features Metrics state [state]
* /tport permissions enable [state] -> /tport features Permissions state [state]
* /tport dynmap enable [state]      -> /tport features Dynmap state [state]
*
* added /tport edit <tport name> whitelist visibility [state]
* This command is used to control the visibility of the whitelist of a TPort in chat and GUI
*
* When a TPort is selected to move in your TPort GUI, dummy items will appear in the GUI at the empty slots to move that TPort to an empty slot
*
* fixed usage of permissions in the cooldown configuration. The permission now support linking other cooldown.
*
* added the tp restriction 'interactRestriction'. Players with this restriction can't interact with the world while a TP is pending
* added the tp restriction 'doSneakRestriction'. Players with this restriction have to sneak at least once while a TP is pending (This restriction is more of a concept for creating your own)
*
* TPort now should start when it's not run from a Spigot server

There are a lot of new features ready/being created right now, but that are not in this update yet.

# Changelog 1.13.3 update:

with /tport edit <TPort name> move <slot> you can give a TPort another place in your TPort gui

# Changelog 1.13.2

* fixed bugs:  
  when TPort private is set to 'online' players in whitelist could not teleport to TPort  
  and other minor bugs
* added cooldown
* removed secret function
* added /tport reload

added new file: TPortConfig.yml
in this file you can edit the cooldowns. the values are in milliseconds.
when you use another cooldown name as value those will be linked.
when you use the value 'permission' the permission 'TPort.<cooldown>.X' is used. the <cooldown> is the cooldown name and the X is the value, this way you can give each player custom cooldown times.

# Changelog 1.12.2

update:
1. the main gui for TPort is now dynamic to the amount of players in the list.
2. you don't have to relog when the plugin is added to the server
3. /tport help is now a book that will open for you. this book is more detailed of how TPort works with examples and all.

this version is tested on 1.12/1.12.1. but I think it works on 1.11 aswell.

---

# Changelog 1.12

this is an update that isn't required for the usage for this plugin, but it has some new features:

1: a new way to teleport to a location

usage: /tport open <playername> <tport name>



if you are familiar with this plugin you might know about /tport open <playername>, but now you can teleport to a location with ony using 1 command and not the inventory



2: better tab complete

example: /tport e

tab complete: edit, extra

before it was not based on the non complete sub-command, but now it looks for a non complete sub-command and creates a new list with suggestions that is based on your pre-written command

---
# Changelog 1.11.3

It will now send a message if you don't have an item in your main hand while you add lore to your item.

---

# Changelog 1.11.2

small change

---

# Changelog 1.11

minor bugfix, if the player to teleport to is offline when your in his gui the head will display "player not online". but when the player get online the head will check if player is online and you will still teleport to the selected player, even the head will say the player is offline.
